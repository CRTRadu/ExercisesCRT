# Exercise 14 - Data Driven Testing

Welcome to **Exercise 14**. Everything you need to know about data driven testing with Copado Robotic Testing.

# Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to learn how data driven testing can be applied, applying multiple iterations of test runs resulting in individual test results.

# Prerequisite(s)

- Access to a Copado Robotic Testing Organization is required
- Access to a Project
- Robot created

# Learning Objectives

- Create your Data Driven Test using Test Template
- Prepare your CSV File with Test Data
- Create your Data Driven Test using DataDriver 3rd party library
- Two options you can use for Individual Test Debugging

# Create your Data Driven Test using Test Template

Let's start with a clearly descriptive data driven tests using Test Data internally within the robot file itself.

1. Create a new empty suite **exercise 14 data driven testing**

2. Create a folder in the root named **14__exercise-data-driven-testing**

3. In folder **14__exercise-data-driven-testing**, create file suite-test-template.robot and copy the contents from here [suite-test-template.robot](suite-test-template.robot)

4. Create a folder in root named **resources**

5. In this foler, create file common.robot and copy the contents from here [common.robot](../resources/common.robot)

5. In this foler, create file leads.robot and copy the contents from here [leads.robot](../resources/leads.robot)

5. Run the test cases in live testing
